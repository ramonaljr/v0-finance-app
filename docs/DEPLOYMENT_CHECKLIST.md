## Deployment

### 1. Pre-Deploy
- [ ] Create backup of production database
- [ ] Run migrations on production Supabase
- [ ] Verify migrations successful
- [ ] Document current production metrics (baseline)

### 2. Deploy to Vercel
```bash
# Ensure all changes committed
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Week 1-2 Sprint - P0/P1 Security & Performance Fixes"
git push origin main
```

- [ ] Push to main branch triggers Vercel deployment
- [ ] Deployment build succeeds
- [ ] No build warnings related to new code
- [ ] Preview deployment reviewed before promoting

### 3. Post-Deploy Verification (Production)

#### Immediate Checks (0-5 minutes)
- [ ] App loads without errors
- [ ] Homepage renders correctly
- [ ] Login/Register works
- [ ] Dashboard loads
- [ ] No 500 errors in Vercel logs

#### Functional Checks (5-15 minutes)
- [ ] AI consent prompt appears for new users
- [ ] AI coach blocked without consent (test in incognito)
- [ ] AI coach works after consent granted
- [ ] Transaction creation works
- [ ] Calculator input works
- [ ] Cache refresh enqueued after transaction
- [ ] No errors in Sentry

#### Performance Checks (15-30 minutes)
- [ ] Dashboard TTI <2s (check Vercel Speed Insights)
- [ ] Web Vitals in green zone (FCP, LCP, CLS)
- [ ] Lighthouse score >90
- [ ] No performance regressions vs. baseline

#### Monitoring Checks (30-60 minutes)
- [ ] Sentry receiving events
- [ ] Vercel Analytics showing traffic
- [ ] No error rate spikes
- [ ] Cache queue processing (check Supabase)

### 4. Rollback Plan (If Needed)

#### Quick Rollback (Vercel)
```bash
# In Vercel dashboard:
# 1. Go to Deployments
# 2. Find previous stable deployment
# 3. Click "..." ‚Üí "Promote to Production"
```

#### Database Rollback (Only if critical)
```sql
-- See MIGRATION_GUIDE.md for full rollback SQL
-- Only rollback if:
-- - No production data created with new schema
-- - Have confirmed backup
-- - Coordinated with team
```

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current State
1. **Cache queue processor**: Stub implementation
   - Manual processing: `SELECT process_cache_refresh_queue();`
   - TODO: Add pg_cron job or edge function cron

2. **Test coverage**: ~60% (goal 80%)
   - Unit tests: ‚úÖ PII redaction, ‚úÖ Recurring engine
   - Integration tests: ‚è≥ Materializers, ‚è≥ CSV import
   - E2E tests: ‚úÖ AI consent, ‚è≥ Full user journey

3. **Sentry source maps**: Requires auth token in CI
   - Manually add `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` to Vercel
   - Verify uploads in Sentry dashboard

4. **Accessibility**: Not yet audited
   - Phase 2: ARIA labels, keyboard nav, contrast fixes

### Non-Blocking Issues
- PII redaction only covers common US patterns (extend in Phase 2)
- Dashboard prefetch only for `/home` route (extend to others)
- Calculator only in transactions page (add to budgets in Phase 2)
