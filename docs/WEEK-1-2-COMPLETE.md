## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Apply database migrations
# Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
# Copy/paste contents of:
#   - supabase/migrations/0002_add_recurring_idempotency.sql
#   - supabase/migrations/0003_add_cache_refresh_queue.sql
# Click "Run" for each

# 2. Add Sentry env vars to Vercel
# Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
# Add: NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN, SENTRY_DSN, SENTRY_ORG, SENTRY_PROJECT, SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN

# 3. Deploy
git push origin main

# 4. Verify deployment
# - Check Vercel deployment logs
# - Visit app and test AI consent
# - Trigger test error → verify in Sentry
# - Check Speed Insights for Web Vitals
```

## 🏆 Sprint Retrospective

### What Went Well
✅ Completed all 10 tasks (100% delivery rate)
✅ Zero scope creep or blockers
✅ Comprehensive documentation created
✅ Found existing AI consent implementation (less work than expected)
✅ Calculator component already existed, just needed integration

### Challenges
⚠️ Sentry wizard timed out (resolved with manual config)
⚠️ pnpm install slow on Windows (mitigated with longer timeouts)
⚠️ Vitest config missing plugin (added @vitejs/plugin-react)

### Improvements for Phase 2
🎯 Run migrations in dev environment during sprint
🎯 Set up Sentry project at sprint start
🎯 Create test fixtures for faster E2E test authoring
🎯 Add pre-commit hooks (Husky + lint-staged)
